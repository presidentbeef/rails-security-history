# Rails Security History

This is a work-in-progress website documenting the history of
vulnerabilities in the Ruby on Rails web framework as well as
security features as they have been introduced over the years.

Initially this information is based on "[The Evolution of Rails Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btrmc1wO3pc)" presented by [Justin Collins](https://github.com/presidentbeef/) at RailsConf 2018.
